                <p id="faq1" class="collapse show">A node is an area connected by the same fiber optic converter. It recognizes, processes and forwards data over coax to your home or business. Viya has over 250 nodes across the Territory. Restoration takes place by node. When a node is activated it sends a connection for Cable, Telephone and/or Internet to all customers attached to that node.</p>

                <p id="faq3" class="collapse">Viya has recently completed network construction on both St. Thomas and St. Croix. On these islands, Viya is now in the process of testing and certifying lines and installing “drops” which are the end of line connection from the main road to your home or business. Please call Viya at 340-777-VIYA(8492) to schedule an appointment if you are still waiting to be restored.</p>

                <p id="faq4" class="collapse">The time it takes for a Node to move from one Phase to the next depends on the size of the node, the damage within it, and how many customers it serves. Viya will be restoring numerous nodes at the same time. Once 75% of the fiber servicing the node is restored (Phase 2), the node will be activated and enter into Phase 3. This involves a visit to EVERY physical address in that area. Our contracted crews are trained to move through this process rapidly but the timing can vary. Phase 3 does NOT mean ALL services are completely restored in the Node. Phase 3 could take a few days or longer, assuming the wiring and equipment inside your home/business is in-tact. <strong>Please note that during 'Phase 3' your service might temporarily <span class="orange">be intermittent</span> as we test and certify the line to make sure it is working optimally. Billing will not resume until your service is confirmed as functioning optimally end-to-end on the correct plan(s) and/or package(s).</strong></p>

Our Business Office Representatives will be able to give you more information on the status and timing of having your Service(s) restored. If you live on St. John, please refer to the map above. Customers in Nodes where network construction (Phase 3) is complete may call for an installation appointment as well.</p>

                <p id="faq15" class="collapse">The short answer is yes, once service has been restored to your home or business Viya can add a service to the service(s) you currently have. However, depending on the service, this may take an installation appointment or alternatively could be done very quickly. A customer with a Cable Modem (eMTA box) already in place in their home may easily add Telephone or Internet service to their account with a simple call to the Viya Business Office. Telephone and Internet service both run through the same piece of equipment and can be turned off or on within a matter of hours. Cable on the other hand need to run through a Cable Box. If a Cable TV customer wishes to add Phone/Internet OR alternatively, a Telephone/Internet Customer would like to add cable TV, an appointment with a Viya installer will be required. Charges are applicable for any new service installation. Please note that installation wait times may be delayed due to dedication of resources to restoration through February.</p>
