                <p id="faq1" class="collapse show">A node is an area connected by the same fiber optic converter. It recognizes, processes and forwards data over coax to your home or business. Viya has over 250 nodes across the Territory. Restoration takes place by node. When a node is activated it sends a connection for Cable, Telephone and/or Internet to all customers attached to that node.</p>

                <p id="faq2" class="collapse">Please visit <a href="www.viya.vi/restoration">www.viya.vi/restoration</a> to locate what node you are in based on the Estate you live in. Please note that nodes and Estates do not share the same borders so this information will be a general guide. Some nodes contain several Estates or an Estate might include several different nodes. Make sure to reference the map to help determine where your particular physical address is located.</p>

                <p id="faq3" class="collapse">Viya has just ramped up the Restoration process with an addition of over 160 crews and over 100 trucks. Viya anticipates being approximately 80% complete by the end of February. Please visit our restoration site: <a href="www.viya.vi/restoration">www.viya.vi/restoration</a> to learn how far along your area is in the process. Timing of completion might depend on number of customers within the node and the extent of the damage.</p>

                <a href="#faq4" class="question" data-toggle="collapse" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4">How long does each “Phase” of restoration take to complete?<i class="toggle-arrow"></i></a>
                    
                <p id="faq4" class="collapse">The time it takes for a Node to move from one Phase to the next depends on the size of the node, the damage within it, and how many customers it serves. Viya will be restoring numerous nodes at the same time. Once 75% of the fiber servicing the node is restored (Phase 2), the node will be activated and enter into Phase 3. This involves a visit to EVERY physical address in that area. Our contracted crews are trained to move through this process rapidly but the timing can vary. Phase 3 does NOT mean ALL services are completely restored in the Node. Phase 3 could take a few days or longer, assuming the wiring and equipment inside your home/business is in-tact. <strong>Please note that during 'Phase 3' your service might temporarily <span class="orange">be intermittent</span> as we test and certify the line to make sure it is working optimally. Billing will not resume until your service is confirmed as functioning optimally end-to-end on the correct plan(s) and/or package(s).</strong></p>

                <p id="faq5" class="collapse">No, you should not need an appointment to have your service restored. Once the fiber backbone in your area is 75% complete we will activate service. Our contract team will then visit your physical address to replace/repair/test your ‘drop’ (the final line and equipment that connects the exterior of your home/business to the network). This should be able to be completed without you being present.  However, if Viya determines that we need to make further repairs INSIDE the home/business or cannot access your home/business’ exterior, an appointment will be necessary. Viya will leave behind a door tag that will instruct you to call and schedule an appointment for further repair.</p>

                <p id="faq9" class="collapse">If Viya determines you need an appointment to repair service within your home or business the initial appointment itself will not be charged to the customer. Viya will also make necessary repairs to the FIRST outlet within your home or business. If you would like an outlet moved, numerous outlets serviced or other inside wiring not directly required to restore service to the first outlet than extra charges may incur. The Viya installer can discuss this with you during your appointment. It is deemed that the Cable Box and/or Cable modem was in-fact damaged due to the Hurricanes Viya will not charge you for replacement of the equipment. However if it is determined that a Cable Box has been damaged due to misuse by the customer, additional charges may be incurred.</p>

                <p id="faq10" class="collapse">All wired services -  Cable, Telephone and Internet - should come on during Phase 3 of restoration. If Cable TV does not come on at the same time as your Internet and/or Telephone service the Cable box MAY be defective or it may not be properly connected. When your area enters into Phase 2 of restoration please make sure ALL Viya boxes are plugged into working electrical outlets and turned on. Viya will be able to identify if there is an issue with your Cable service and will notify you if an appointment with a technician or equipment replacement is necessary.</p>

                <p id="faq11" class="collapse">Not unless requested by a Viya employee or contractor. If Viya determines we need to make repairs within your home or business, we will assess the state of your equipment at this time. Viya should have replacement equipment stocked inside the truck to make any necessary equipment change. If however, the Viya installer does not have the necessary change of equipment on-hand you may be given the option of either exchanging it at a Customer Experience Center near you or scheduling a second appointment.</p>

                <p id="faq15" class="collapse">The short answer is yes, once service has been restored to your home or business Viya can add a service to the service(s) you currently have. However, depending on the service, this may take an installation appointment or alternatively could be done very quickly. A customer with a Cable Modem (eMTA box) already in place in their home may easily add Telephone or Internet service to their account with a simple call to the Viya Business Office. Telephone and Internet service both run through the same piece of equipment and can be turned off or on within a matter of hours. Cable on the other hand need to run through a Cable Box. If a Cable TV customer wishes to add Phone/Internet OR alternatively, a Telephone/Internet Customer would like to add cable TV, an appointment with a Viya installer will be required. Charges are applicable for any new service installation. Please note that installation wait times may be delayed due to dedication of resources to restoration through February.</p>
